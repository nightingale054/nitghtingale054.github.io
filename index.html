            <p> The cats are asleep. Except for the <em> shiny </em> one. May be marrauding
              around downtown - but definitely not up and down St. Laurent.
            </p>
            <p> That's not <strong> his </strong> pattern.

            <p> This is also a tree and not a snoring girl. It's amazing
            that she sleeps through half past midnight on a party street.
            I tried to show her this beautiful baby, but she whined, so,
            I guess she only gets to see it when it's closer to pretty? Alas -
            despite my intentions I must stop. There is loud drumming outside.
            So appropriate at 1 am. Because no one lives any life other than
            fest here..... ugh. Let mortals sleep, at least.
            </p>
            <p> Strange, however, that all the pictures are of trees... I must
            think I'm good at tree-tography.</p>
            <p>That was really lame.</p>
            <p>Whoopsie!</p>

            <p>This is a <strong>tree</strong> and not <em>me</em>.
            I miss the little crab signs and other cute parking identifiers
            at <a href= https://www.butchartgardens.com>Butchart Gardens</a>
            more than I knew I would. I miss Victoria, too, I guess, but if I'd stayed there, I
            wouldn't have started this.</p>
            <p>And I like this. It's a good this. The title's a bit gratuitous.

          <p> Hello, you. For some reason I decided to make a website; and now
          I'm wondering why I didn't sooner.</p>
